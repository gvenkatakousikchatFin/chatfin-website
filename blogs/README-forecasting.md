# AI Financial Forecasting - ChatFin

Achieve 40% better forecast accuracy with [ChatFin](https://chatfin-website.vercel.app/) machine learning models.

## The Forecasting Problem

Manual forecasting is:
- **Time-consuming** - 2-4 weeks per cycle
- **Inaccurate** - 70-75% accuracy average
- **Static** - quarterly updates don't adapt
- **Limited** - can't analyze complex patterns
